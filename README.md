# ITAT Hardware Task
## Low Budget NASA equipment
Imagine you are part of a NASA team, and Wark Matney is stranded on Mars (a distant cousin of the main character in the movie "The Martian"). You need to send him messages, but all you have is a simple observation camera that can rotate to point at different markers—no fancy communication systems! As a low-budget prototype, we will simulate this scenario using a servo motor to rotate and "communicate" by pointing at different positions. This project will help you learn how to control hardware with code, just like NASA engineers do in space missions.

## Project Summary
This project is a C++ embedded application developed for the LP_MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad, utilizing Texas Instruments' DriverLib and SysConfig tools. The main objective is to demonstrate the use of various microcontroller peripherals—GPIO, PWM (TimerG), and RGB LEDs—by decoding a hexadecimal message and actuating hardware components accordingly.

### Key Features
Hexadecimal Message Decoding:
The core logic is implemented in the HexDecoder class, which processes a vector of hexadecimal values representing a message. Each byte is split into two nibbles, and each nibble is mapped to a servo angle using a lookup table.

- __Servo Motor Control:__
The ServoMotor class uses PWM signals generated by TimerG to rotate a servo to specific angles based on decoded hex values.

- __GPIO LED Control:__
The GPIOLed class provides simple methods to enable, disable, and toggle a GPIO-controlled LED, used as an indicator during decoding.

- __RGB LED Feedback:__
The RGBLight class manages an RGB LED, providing visual feedback for different decoding states (e.g., blue for processing, red for error, green for success).

- __Hardware Abstraction:__
All hardware interactions are abstracted into classes, making the code modular and easier to maintain or extend.

## Workflow
1. __Initialization__:
The system and peripherals are initialized in main.
2. __Message Decoding__:
A predefined message (e.g., "ITAT IS FUN!") is stored as a vector of hex bytes and passed to the HexDecoder::decode method.
3. __Servo and LED Actions__:
For each letter in the message:
    - The servo rotates to a corresponding angle.
    - If the hexadecimal number is greater than 7, an additional LED is enabled.
    - RGB LED color indicates the current state (processing, error, or success).
4. __Error Handling__:
If an invalid value is encountered, the RGB LED turns red and the process aborts.
5. __Completion__:
On successful decoding, the RGB LED turns green.


#### Additional Notes
The project is intended for educational purposes and is not optimized for production embedded systems.
The codebase demonstrates C++ best practices for embedded development, including encapsulation, modularity, and use of STL containers where appropriate.
