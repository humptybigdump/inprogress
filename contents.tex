\section{Introduction}
The introduction should clearly define the phenomenon or event being studied, such as a hurricane, heatwave, or other climate or weather-related events. This should explain why this phenomenon is significant in climate and environmental science, including its potential impacts and relevance. Additionally, the section should outline the objective of using the machine learning model in this analysis, highlighting how it contributes to understanding or predicting the phenomenon.

\newpage

\section{Methods}
This section should provide a detailed explanation of the methods used in the analysis. Include the following subsections:

\subsection{Machine Learning Model / AI architecture}
Describe the machine learning model used for the study, such as NeuralGCM or FourCastNet. Include details about the model architecture, pretraining process, and any relevant configurations.

\subsection{Data Acquisition and Preprocessing}
Explain the sources of the data, such as the ERA5 or CMIP6 datasets, and describe any pre-processing steps performed. This might include data cleaning, normalization, or augmentation steps to prepare the data for analysis.

\subsection{Post-Processing and Index Calculation}
Discuss how the model outputs are post-processed to derive meaningful indices related to the phenomenon studied. Include mathematical definitions or formulas for the indices, the steps of calculation, and any validation or comparison with observed data.

\newpage

\subsection*{Citation examples}

NeuralGCM is a recently published hybrid model by Google and collaborators \cite{kochkov2024neural}, which in particular targets AI forecasting of atmospheric variables on weather-relevant timescales (up to two weeks in advance).

FourCastNet is a cutting-edge deep learning weather forecasting model developed by NVIDIA and collaborators \cite{pathak2022fcastnet}. It uses machine learning to predict atmospheric variables such as temperature, wind, and pressure on a global scale, offering a faster and more efficient alternative to traditional numerical weather prediction models.

\subsection*{Math example}
The formula for the \textbf{Temperature-Humidity Index (THI)} is commonly expressed as:
\begin{align}
    THI &= T - \left(0.55 - 0.0055 \cdot RH\right) \cdot \left(T - 14.5\right)
    \label{eq:HTI}
\end{align}

where $T$ and $RH$ are air temperature in Â°C and relative humidity in percentage (\%), respectively.
